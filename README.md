# 🚀 Smart Assistant for Computer Interaction

## Overview

Welcome to the **Smart Assistant** GitHub repository! This project is designed to enable users to perform tasks on their computer using **🗣️ speech input** and **👁️ visual analysis** of the computer screen. The assistant combines natural language processing (NLP) and real-time screen analysis to create an intuitive hands-free experience for interacting with your desktop environment.

With this assistant, users can control various applications, automate tasks, and perform everyday actions like opening programs, managing files, and browsing the web, all via simple voice commands. 🖥️🎙️

## 🌟 Features

- **🗣️ Speech Command Recognition**: The assistant listens to your voice and processes natural language commands.
- **👁️ Screen Recognition**: It visually analyzes the screen to understand which windows, applications, and elements are currently displayed.
- **🤖 Task Automation**: Automatically performs tasks like opening apps, sending emails, copying files, and more based on voice commands and screen context.
- **🔄 Cross-Application Support**: Works with multiple software environments, such as browsers, text editors, and productivity tools.
- **🧠 Context Awareness**: Recognizes the current state of your desktop to execute commands in the right context (e.g., switching between applications, interacting with open windows).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following:

- **🐍 Python 3.x**: Required for running the assistant's core logic.
